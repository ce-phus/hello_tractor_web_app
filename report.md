# Hello Tractor E-commerce application with Django and Vite

This project involves the design and development of a secondary marketplace platform for buying and selling second-hand tractors and agricultural implements. The platform provided a seamless user experience for both buyers and sellers, integrating features like secure registration, intuitive search, filtering options, messaging system and secure payment integration with Paystack.

## Team Members
- ### Peter Nakitare

## Tech Sack Used
- `Vite`: React frontend framework
- `Django`: A high level python web framework tht encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design
- `Redis`:An in memory database, a memory cache, that can persist data on a disk, allowing fast data access and storage
- `Daphne`: Is a HTTP, HTTP2 and websocketts protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP, developed to power Django channels
- `Django-Channels`: Is a project that takes django and extends its abilities beyond HTTP-to handle websockets, chat protocols and more. It is built on a python specification called ASGI.
- `Tailwind css`: Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. Unlike other frameworks, like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.
- `Reduxjs`: Redux is a predictable state container for javascript applications. Used for managing the state of the application, such as user interaactions, cat=rt functionalities and API responses
- `Djoser` : A python-based custom authentication library
- `DRF REST APIs`: Stateless and scalable APIs, allowing seamless communication between the frontend and backend

## Challenges 
 #### Deployment of the django application to render
- Dependancy conflicts and django setup on ASGI operations while using the gunicorn server
- Serving of mediafiles at the render backend application, read a documentation that render does not fully support serving of mediafiles with django, recommemdation is to serve mediafiles in a S3 Amazon bucket or user a different backend hosting platform

## Recommendation for the challenges
- Containerise the application using docker and serve the backend the client applications with a load balancer/proxy with nginx or apache to manage requests and for a highly scalable application

## Lessons Learnt

- Deployment of the applications on render, both static and the web service
